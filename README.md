#Lab 1.2

 ________________________________________Important message________________________________________
Hi tutor, 
I would like to notice that for the 1.2, please use your Visual Studio Code and click "go live" in the under right corner to see my fully functional website. Only by this way, the website works as intended; otherwise, it just shows a styled website without its most crucial functionality - the graphs. This is caused since the visualization requires a local server (like VS Code's 'Go Live') because browsers block direct file access from disk due to security policies (for instance, it blocks loading local files via file:// protocol for security). The server enables proper loading of the CSV data and other assets.
